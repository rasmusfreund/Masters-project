  abstract = {Today machine learning methods are commonly deployed for bacterial species identification using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data. However, most of the studies reported in literature only consider very traditional machine learning methods on small datasets that contain a limited number of species. In this paper we present benchmarking results on an unprecedented scale for a wide range of machine learning methods, using datasets that contain almost 100,000 spectra and more than 1000 different species. The size and the diversity of the data allow to compare three important identification scenarios that are often not distinguished in literature, i.e., identification for novel biological replicates, novel strains and novel species that are not present in the training data. The results demonstrate that in all three scenarios acceptable identification rates are obtained, but the numbers are typically lower than those reported in studies with a more limited analysis. Using hierarchical classification methods, we also demonstrate that taxonomic information is in general not well preserved in MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data. For the novel species scenario, we apply for the first time neural networks with Monte Carlo dropout, which have shown to be successful in other domains, such as computer vision, for the detection of novel species.},

  abstract = {Although nosocomial infections by Staphylococcus epidermidis have gained much attention, this skin-colonizing bacterium has apparently evolved not to cause disease, but to maintain the commonly benign relationship with its host. Accordingly, S. epidermidis does not produce aggressive virulence determinants. Rather, factors that normally sustain the commensal lifestyle of S. epidermidis seem to give rise to additional benefits during infection. Furthermore, we are beginning to comprehend the roles of S. epidermidis in balancing the epithelial microflora and serving as a reservoir of resistance genes. In this Review, I discuss the molecular basis of the commensal and infectious lifestyles of S. epidermidis.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli is probably the best-known bacterial species and one of the most frequently isolated organisms from clinical specimens. Despite this, underappreciation and misunderstandings exist among medical professionals and the lay public alike regarding E. coli as an extraintestinal pathogen. Underappreciated features include (i) the wide variety of extraintestinal infections E. coli can cause, (ii) the high incidence and associated morbidity, mortality, and costs of these diverse clinical syndromes, (iii) the pathogenic potential of different groups of E. coli strains for causing intestinal versus extraintestinal disease, and (iv) increasing antimicrobial resistance. In this era in which health news often sensationalizes uncommon infection syndromes or pathogens, the strains of E. coli that cause extraintestinal infection are an increasingly important endemic problem and underappreciated “killers”. Billions of health care dollars, millions of work days, and hundreds of thousands of lives are lost each year to extraintestinal infections due to E. coli. New treatments and prevention measures will be needed for improved outcomes and a diminished disease burden.},
